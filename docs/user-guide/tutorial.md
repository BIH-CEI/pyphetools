# Tutorial


The goal of the pyphetools library is to provide a software framework for transforming tabular
data about cohorts with rare of common disease into a collection
of [GA4GH phenopackets](https://phenopacket-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/){:target="\_blank"}. We have applied to library
to extract phenopackets from tables provided as supplemental files of publications describing cohorts of individuals with a rare disease
(Excel, tab or comma-separated value files, and even files copied into a spreadsheet application from the original PDF file of the article).
Additionally, an Excel template can be used to enter data about collections of case reports. pyphetools can also be used as a Python software library,
and detailed API documentation is provided.
