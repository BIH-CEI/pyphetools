# Data-Entry Template

pyphetools offers two main ways to encode clinical data as phenopackets. The library provides various functions to encode data found in
typical supplementary materials of publications about cohorts. This option, which is covered in more detail in TODO is intended for those
with skills in scripting with Python. Additionally, pyphetools can ingest data encoded in an Excel template that can be used without additional scripting.
The template can be ingested using a standardized notebook. Alternatively, users are invited to work with the HPO team to enter the data into the HPO database.
