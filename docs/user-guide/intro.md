# User guide


pyphetools is designed to be used in Jupyter notebook environments to encode tabular data as collections
of [GA4GH phenopackets](https://phenopacket-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>). 
See the notebooks on the 
project [GitHub repository](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/pyphetools).
For a comprehensive collection of notebooks created with pyphetools, see the 
[phenopacket-store repo](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/phenopacket-store).

The pages in this user guide provide high-level explanations for the most important classes of 
pyphetools that should  be sufficient for most users of the library. 
The API documentation provides additional 
details for developers.
