pyphetools is designed to be used in Jupyter notebook environments to encode tabular data as collections
of `GA4GH phenopackets <https://phenopacket-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. See the notebooks on the 
project `GitHub repository <https://github.com/monarch-initiative/pyphetools>`_ or in the 
`phenopacket-store repo <https://github.com/monarch-initiative/phenopacket-store>`_ for detailed examples.
The pages in this folder provide high-level explanations for the most important classes of pyphetools that should
be sufficient for most users of the library. The API documentation provides additional details for developers.
